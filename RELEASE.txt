Mondrian 3.5.0-GA production release notes
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.5.0 is a bugfix release based off the previous 3.4.1 version.
It includes many enhancements and performance fixes as well as better
native support for native resolution of tuples when access controls
are added.

We have also significantly improved the performance when dealing with
levels of high cardinality as well as enabled Mondrian to run into
a real-time mode where nothing gets cached and the data it returns
is always the latest from the source.

To find out more about Mondrian, go to http://mondrian.pentaho.com.

Contents
--------

As usual, there are two distributions for this release:
 * mondrian-<version>.zip contains the FoodMart dataset in
   SQL and Access format
 * mondrian-<version>-derby.zip contains the FoodMart
   dataset as an Apache Derby database

Each distribution contains the full mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including
generated API documentation, and a web archive mondrian.war.
This web archive contains all classes and libraries (jars)
necessary to run mondrian.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.com/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.

Main functionality in this release
----------------------------------
 - Tuples evaluation now push down natively the constraints
   imposed by roles.
 - Fixes some issues in the way Mondrian was splitting segments
   across multiple sub-segments.
 - Resolving tuples only joins to the fact table if absolutely
   necessary.
 - Improved processing of large volumes of data when a member grant
   is used with a partial rollup policy.
 - Enables a mode in which nothing gets cached and the data returned
   is always the latest available from the database.
 - Allows more than one measure to be included in the RETURN clause
   of a DRILLTHROUGH statement.
 - Added support for native evaluation of regular expressions with
   Netezza.
 - Upgraded Apache Xerces.

API changes from 3.4.1 to 3.5.0
---------------------------
 - Changes to the effects of the property 'mondrian.rolap.DisableCache'
 - Introduces a new property to disable the default in-memory cache
   for segments.
 - Added a new method to specify the roles for a connection to allow
   the presence of commas in role names.
 - Allows to specify a minimum TTL value for schemas in the pool through
   connection properties.
 - Allows to specify a unique connection UUID to force the usage of a
   specific schema in the pool through connection properties.

See CHANGES.txt for a list of all source code changes
since the previous release.


Mondrian 3.4.0-GA production release notes
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.4.0-GA is a major refactoring of Mondrian's internals
and the way it handles & stores the cell data. This release makes
Mondrian much more scalable and much more effective in the way it
uses the system threads.

This release also introduces a new algorithm to load, share and
rollup the data cells, or segments. Mondrian will rollup and union
the segment data from low levels, in memory, to answer queries
related to higher levels. This provides a huge improvement in
performance on systems with high user interactivity.

It is also worth noting that the Mondrian project now hosts its
source code on github. The official source code can now be found
at: github.com/pentaho/mondrian

   dataset as an Apache Derby database

Each distribution contains the full mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including

This web archive contains all classes and libraries (jars)
necessary to run mondrian.

This release runs on Java version 1.5 and higher. For
backwards compatibility on Java 1.4, substitute
mondrian-jdk14.jar for mondrian.jar, and add
retroweaver-rt-1.2.4.jar to your classpath.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.com/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.

Main functionality in this release
----------------------------------
 - Support for olap4j 1.0.1 and JDBC 4.1.
 - Simplified and improved the SegmentCache SPI.
 - Introduces the Mondrian Monitor API.
 - Refactored some key parts of the engine into an
   implementation of the Actor design pattern, providing more
   effective resource sharing and the elimination of many
   synchronization blocks.
 - SQL queries for cell data is now fetched by a multi-threaded
   executor and the tasks are shared among the query threads.
 - More than one SegmentCache implementations can now be used
   at a time.
 - Ability to combine the data of multiple segments for a single
   query.
 - Ability to combine data of an existing segment with data form SQL.
 - Support for the DRILLTHROUGH RETURN clause.
 - Ability to define non-measure calculated members in a cube
   under a specific parent.
 - Allow aggregate tables to join to middle levels of snowflake
   dimension.
 - As usual, many other bug fixes and performance tweaks.

API changes from 3.3.to 3.4
---------------------------
 - Substantial changes to SegmentCache
 - Upgraded to olap4j-1.0.1.500

since the previous release.


Mondrian 3.3.0.14703 production release notes
=============================================
=======
Mondrian 4.0.0 beta release notes
=================================
>>>>>>> upstream/4.0

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 4.0.0 is a beta release of a new major version of the
leading open-source OLAP engine. To find out more about mondrian,
go to http://mondrian.pentaho.com.

Contents
--------

The distribution is contained in the file mondrian-<version>.zip.
Each distribution contains the full Mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including generated API
documentation.

The main interface to Mondrian is its olap4j driver,
mondrian.olap4j.MondrianOlap4jDriver.

This release runs on Java version 1.5 and higher. For
backwards compatibility on Java 1.4, substitute
mondrian-jdk14.jar for mondrian.jar, and add
retroweaver-rt-1.2.4.jar to your classpath.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.com/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.

Main functionality in this release
----------------------------------

 - Measure groups
 - Attributes
 - Time dimension generator
 - Composite keys
 - Physical schema
 - API to define aggregate tables (not yet complete)
 - Schema format does not require XML elements to be in a
   particular order.
 - Schema validation gives multiple errors and warnings, and
   errors and warnings have a precise XML location.
 - If connection property 'Ignore' is specified, warnings do not
   prevent a connection from being established.

Limitations
-----------

Some functionality is not complete in this beta version.
 - Ragged hierarchies are not supported.
 - No all native SQL optimizations supported in Mondrian-3.x
   still work.
 - There are approximately 250 test failures out of 2700 tests.
 - Pentaho Analyzer does not yet work against Mondrian-4.
 - It's not as easy as it should be to download and load sample
   data sets such as FoodMart.
 - Default value of Attribute.hasHierarchy is currently false.
   Before production, this will change it to true, if attribute
   is not included in any hierarchies.

API and MDX language changes from 3.x to 4.0
--------------------------------------------

 - Mondrian-4 is compatible with olap4j version 1.0.1.
 - In MDX, hierarchy elements must be specified using
   [dimension].[hierarchy], and level elements must be specified
   using [dimension].[hierarchy].[level]. (In Mondrian-3.x, this
   behavior was enabled only if the property
   mondrian.olap.SsasCompatibleNaming was set to true.)
 - The following deprecated APIs have been removed:
  -- mondrian.olap.DimensionType
  -- mondrian.olap.LevelType
- createDimension has been removed from the API mondrian.olap.Schema
 - TODO

Other changes from 3.x to 4.0
-----------------------------

The XML schema format is not compatible between
versions. Mondrian-3.x software would not be able to read a
Mondrian-4 schema, and Mondrian-4 software can read a Mondrian-3
schema only because it recognizes that the schema is a legacy
format and internally converts to Mondrian-4 format.

We recommend using the metamodelVersion attribute of the Schema
element, to make it clear which version the schema is intended
for. This attribute is mandatory from 4.0 onwards.

The schema converter can handle most schemas, but has the
following limitations. It cannot recognize uses of columns in
expressions and convert them to Column elements.

The VirtualCube element is obsolete. The equivalent in Mondrian-4
is a Cube that contains multiple MeasureGroups.

The AggName element is obsolete. In Mondrian-4 you define
aggregate tables using the MeasureGroup element (which is also
used to define fact tables).

The AggPattern element is obsolete. There is no direct way in
Mondrian-4 to define a set of aggregate tables by
pattern-matching the names of tables and columns in the
schema. You can use the new aggregate table API to scan the
schema and define aggregate tables.

The standard demonstration schema is now called
FoodMart.mondrian.xml.  (The longer extension helps tools such as
Pentaho more easily identify the purpose of the file.)  It is in
version 4 format, of course. The previous demonstration schema,
which was called FoodMart.xml in version 3, is now called
FoodMart3.mondrian.xml.

In 3.x releases, the mondrian-<version>.zip file contained the
FoodMart data set in MySQL and Microsoft Access formats, and
there was an additional mondrian-<version>-derby.zip containing
the FoodMart data set in Apache Derby format. The binary
distribution of this release does not contain the data set. It
can be downloaded from
http://repo.pentaho.org/artifactory/repo/pentaho/mondrian-data-foodmart.

JPivot is no longer included with the release. Neither is there a
mondrian.war file in the distribution.

Schema workbench is obsolete and has been removed. Pentaho hopes
to build a replacement, but no firm plans exist at this time.

XMLA server has been removed from the Mondrian code base. It is
now a separate project. See
https://github.com/julianhyde/olap4j-xmlaserver.

The "high-cardinality dimensions" feature has been removed. There
are better ways to support dimensions that have large numbers of
members.

See CHANGES.txt for a list of all source code changes since the
previous release.

Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x
---------------------------------------
Mondrian 3 schemas will be automatically upgraded to Mondrian 4 
schemas internally.  Set the log4j log level for 
mondrian.rolap.RolapSchemaUpgrader to DEBUG to log the XML for the
upgraded schema.

Bugs and feature requests fixed for 4.0
---------------------------------------
TODO

Removed

To be removed
-------------
Property.formatter (XML attribute)
SchemaGrant.access value "all_dimensions"
